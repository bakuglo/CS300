What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I was solving during this course was correcting code in each different type of data structure and learning how each of them holds data and sorts through it as well. I also learned to create much better psuedocode during my time in this course!
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached each problem with caution and understanding of each data structure. Figuring out how each different data structure is ordered and sorted is important because they provide efficient ways to organize, store, and manipulate data in computer programs. Mastery of data structures enables efficient algorithm design, and improves program performance.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Any roadblocks that I encountered were easily overcomed by going back through the course material and I actually reached out to a tutor at SNHU a couple of times to grasp a better understanding.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project expanded my approach because of the understanding of all of the different data structures. Learning how to carefully read through code has helped as well. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learned to make sure that all of my code is clean and readable by making sure that I understood how to structure my code so that each data structure is executed correctly and that the program will run as it is supposed to.
